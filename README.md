## What is SEAR ?
SEAR 2.0 is a full conversion of a structured tabletop system like D&D 5E into Helldivers. It includes classes, combat system, monsters, stats and leveling all adapted to fit the Helldivers theme. It exists to translate roleplay into pressure, uncertainty, sacrifice, and earned triumph. Every choice matters. Every roll carries weight. Every victory costs something. If you walk away alive, it is because you planned well, adapted fast, or were lucky when luck mattered most.
